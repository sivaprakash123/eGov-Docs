Philosophy
We welcome anyone willing to take the journey of solving hard to crack urban governance challenges. Our philosophy is to build Open source , interoperable and scalable solutions where anyone can contribute to making urban governance more efficient.

DIGIT has been conceived and designed as an open governance platform. The “openness” of the platform means that the platform is available for anyone to configure or customize  to solve with open access to the source code.
