The DIGIT platform makes it possible to leverage technology for urban governance and citizen interaction by providing building blocks for the creation of governance solutions. DIGIT contains well architected common building blocks that can be orchestrated to create multiple solutions without the need to build from scratch. The architecture also allows for re-use of common infrastructure components for a governance platform such as master data ontology, workflow definitions, data encryption and machine learning insights.
